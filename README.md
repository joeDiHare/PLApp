# PLApp
This is the code used to generate, compile and email android apps that contain video playlists (aka "PLApp"). 

The project is described in more details here: www.makeaplaylistapp.com.

The videos are organised as advent calendar; a new video is unlocked every day, and you can include a personalised message too.

Here is an example.
You want to send a special gift to someone you care about. Perhaps, that gift could be a playlist with videos & songs that one can access every day for a week or two. 
But most options out there are cold and apathetic. 
Now you are thinking, I want this so badly, but HOW ON EARTH CAN I DO IT?? 

>>> PLApp.

Watch the video on www.makeaplaylistapp.com/how-does-it-work and, to make one, visit .../makeit.
Here are the main points of the PlayList App ("PLAPP") you will be emailed:
-It contains a playlist with links of songs or videos youâ€™ve chosen
-The playlist is organised similar to an advent calendar, with one new link becoming active every day from a starting day
-Max 31 songs/weblinks
-Every song can have a personalized message that is shown when the user clicks on the button
-You will have to provide the #links to the songs and the#messages in a google form to be found on this webpage
-The app is ONLY for #ANDROID (no iPhone, no windows mobiles, no BB)
-Can't personalize other aspects of the app; maybe in the future...
